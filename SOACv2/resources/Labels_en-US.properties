computadornaoxpandido=\u0020This circle represents a computer.\n Click in this circle to see its internal\n components and start the simulation.
computadorexpandido=\u0020This circle represents a computer with its main\n components represented by circles. To see details\n of each of them and start the simulation with them\n involved, click in the circle which represent them.
memoriaprincipaltxt=\u0020This circle represents a main memory.\n The main memory can store both instructions\n and data. To visualize the organization of the\n main memory with more details, click in this circle.
entradasaidatxt=\u0020This circle represents the input/output devices, which can be divided into three categories:\n 1 - Human readable: suitable for the communication with computer users. Examples: video monitors and printers.\n 2 - Machine readable: suitable for the communication with hardware equipments. Examples: magnetic disks, sensors and actuators.\n 3 - Communication: suitable for the communication with remote devices. Examples: terminal, network adapter and other computer.
ucptxt=\u0020This circle represents a CPU (Central Processing Unit).\n A CPU is constituted by registers, arithmetic and logic unit,\n internal bus and control unit. To see more details about\n each of these components, click with the mouse.
memoriainternatxt=\u0020The main memory is represented here by two tables:\n one that stores instructions and other that stores data.\n In the instructions table, the columns are the following: \n - Address: The memory address that the instruction occupies\n - Opcode: A code that identifies the type of the instruction,\n   related with the operands 1 and 2.\n - Operands 1 and 2: Numbers that identify the memory\n   address of a data, a data or one of the CPU registers,\n   depending of the addressing mode of these operands.\n Each line of the data table contains what the programmers\n define as variables. This table have two columns, in the first,\n the address of an inserted variable is contained and in the\n second, the data that this variable stores.
registradorestxt = \u0020The registers store data and references to the memory.\n The access time to the registers is much faster, if\n compared to the access time of the main memory.
pctxt = \u0020The PC (Program Counter) stores the value\n of the next instruction to be executed, for when\n a instruction finishes its execution, the CPU knows\n what will be the next instruction that it will have to\n execute.
martxt=\u0020The MAR (Memory Address Register) is responsible\n for storing the references of memory addresses that\n will be transferred to the addresses bus in a reading\n of a data or instruction of the main memory.
mbrtxt=\u0020The MBR (Memory Buffer Register) is responsible\n for storing the data that will be written in the main\n memory by the data bus and for receiving the data\n or memory instructions in a reading operation,\n through this same bus.
irtxt=\u0020The IR (Instruction Register) is responsible\n for storing the instructions that come from memory.
ulatxt=\u0020The ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit) is the\n responsible for executing the logical and arithmetic\n operations, such as additions, subtractions,\n multiplications and divisions.
uctxt=\u0020The CU (Control Unit) coordinates the CPU\n activities. It sends the instructions of reading\n data or instructions of writing data to the\n instructions bus. Moreover, it is responsible\n for sending instructions that will realize internal\n operations in the CPU, as updating the PC,\n realizing arithmetic operations and transferring\n data between components of the CPU by\n its internal bus.
barramentotxt=\u0020This component is part of the interconnection\n system. To see more details about one of these\n components, click in the circle \"Bus\" or \"I/O Module\".
barramentointernotxt=\u0020The bus is where the data or instructions\n of the main memory flow to the CPU or vice\n versa. It is constituted by three sub-buses:\n the instructions bus, the addresses bus and\n the data bus where flow CU instructions,\n memory addresses and data, respectively.
#messages of the search cycle
continuar=Continue
naomostrarmensagens=Don't show messages
atualizarpctxt=\u0020The search cycle will start now, to search the next\n instruction in the memory. The PC value is updated\n with the instruction address that will be executed\n in the next.
movermartxt =\u0020The PC value is then transferred to the MAR, which\n contain the addresses that will be transferred from\n the bus to the memory and that comes from memory\n through the bus.
compiareadbarramentotxt=\u0020The control unit is responsible for coordinating\n the CPU activities. In this case, it sends the \"READ\"\n command to the bus, meaning that the CPU is\n requiring a data reading from memory.
copiarvalormarbarramentotxt = \u0020As well as the command \"READ\", the MAR value,\n that contains the address of the next instruction,\n is also transferred to the bus.
moverdadosbarramentomemoriatxt= \u0020These two values will be transferred to the memory,\n through the bus. The MAR value in the addresses bus\n and the \"READ\" command in the instructions bus.
transferirinstrucaotxt=\u0020The instruction requested  is then transferred to the\n CPU through the data bus. Initially, the MBR will be the\n register containing the instruction, because it stores the\n data or instructions as soon as they come from memory.
atualizarpcproxinstrucaotxt = \u0020The PC value is updated to contain the value\n of the next instruction..
naohaproxinstrucaotxt=\u0020Since there is no next instruction to be\n executed, the PC value is not altered.
copiarmbrparairtxt=\u0020The instruction, that is in the\n MBR, is copied to the IR, the instruction register.
